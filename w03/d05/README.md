### Lab Overview!

Today, you're going to use your Ruby chops to build **your own CLI!** This is an open-ended assignment – you may use an API or build your CLI from scratch.

Start by coming up with a **MVP** – minimum viable product – and brainstorm "extra" features. **Once you decide on a direction, Slack a brief (1-2 sentence) proposal to the instructors for approval.**

Implement your MVP first, and then add the extras. We'll meet back for presentations at **4:30 PM**.

We've **assigned random groups**:
* Munish, Noble
* Jason, Jeremy
* Kelly, Todd
* Allie, Zolon
* Antonia, Christy
* Lauren, Alison
* James, Ryan

### Some Simple API's
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/)
* [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
* [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod)
* [Cat API](http://thecatapi.com/)
* [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)
* [Unsplash Source API](https://source.unsplash.com/)


---

### Necessary Deliverables
* A link to a Github repository containing your CLI
* Your README.md file should contain a short description of your CLI, as well as instructions on how to run it

---

### Bonus
* Try to make your code object-oriented!


---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started
* You might want to start with something like the following:
  * CLI prints welcome message
  * CLI prompts the user for input
  * CLI makes a simple call to *X* API using the user input
  * CLI outputs results
* If you get stuck, use `binding.pry` to inspect your variables!
* Alternatively, you may build a CLI that does not use an API, such as Mad Libs or Blackjack.
