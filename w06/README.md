# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Rails app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**You will be working in groups for this project**, and you'll be designing the app with your group. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Utilize an ORM (ActiveRecord) to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

---
### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes and ERD's of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* Any **user stories** you created

---
### SCRUM
We will have scrum sessions every morning, but we encourage your own group to conduct scrum sessions as well at the end of the day.

You'll be asked to answer the following questions in the morning: 

* What did I accomplish yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What obstacles are impeding my progress?

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
* **Draw diagrams** It's easy to get lost in the code and forget what part of the app you are working in and why - draw our MVC diagram out and take a look at it when you get confused, to remind you of where you are.

### Additional Tips

* Work together initially to come up with wireframes, user stories, ERD's etc, but adopt a "divide and conquer" type approach afterwards
* Try pair programming through the tougher parts of your application
* Deploy early, don't wait until the day before to attempt doing this

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

### Potential Ideas
Here is a list of potential ideas for an appropriately sized app. Feel free to use these ideas, or change them around as needed to fit what you want to do.

1) Movie Review App
- An app that allows users to add movies, add reviews for those movies, rate movies on a 1-5 star rating system, and even save their favorite movies.

2) Yelp for X Type of Business
- Allow users to rank, rate, review, or otherwise vote on a certain type of business.

3) Food Truck Tracker/Locator
- Users can find their favorite food trucks, locate them on a map, see their menu, read their Tweets, and even add new food trucks.

4) Personal Job App Tracker
- An organizational app for users to keep track of jobs they've applied to. Users can sort jobs into categories/stages ("Pending", "Applied", "Offered", etc.), tag them, and share job listings with friends.

5) Concert Finder
- Let a user find and save their favorite artists, then find nearby concerts by that artist coming soon.

6) Social Network for Enthusiasts of...?
- Build a social network that allows users to "friend" or "follow" other users, create a "profile", and send messages to each other. The app could be about a certain topic, like soccer or bird watching... anything really.

### BONUS IDEAS
**REMEMBER TO GET YOUR MVP DEPLOYED BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO THE BONUS!!**
- Add Tagging
- Add "Like"-ing
- Add Upvoting and Downvoting
- Add Commenting
- Implement User auth with Twitter, Google, or Facebook.
- Implement another API you think would benefit this app.
- Implement email or text notifications.
- Add in admin functionality to see all users' data.
- Add the ability for Friends OR a Follower/Following relationship between users.
- Anything else your little heart desires
