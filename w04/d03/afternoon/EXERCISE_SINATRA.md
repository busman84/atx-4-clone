## Your Own Sinatra App, Layouts & Templates

**30 min**

Now that you've gotten a taste of your first framework, practice is key. While you're in practice mode, take this opportunity to spin up a new app from scratch and practice all the setup & syntax you can. The more you do it, the more it becomes muscle memory, and the faster & better you'll get.

- Build a new Sinatra app from scratch that uses layouts & templates, incorporating everything you've learned today
  - Make an empty RESTful controller with one or two views
  - Experiment with building parameters into GET requests & rendering views to see what happens

You should end up with a pretty barebones app, but one that starts up and runs with a couple of routes.
